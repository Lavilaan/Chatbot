# Customizable and Secure Chatbot for Reliance Jio

## Project Overview
This project focuses on developing a customizable and secure chatbot to enhance user interaction at Reliance Jio. The chatbot allows users to select from multiple large language models (LLMs), adjust temperature settings, and personalize their interaction experience. The system ensures data security through localization, integrates with existing infrastructure, and provides a user interface similar to ChatGPT for seamless and efficient customer service.

## Features
- **Model Selection:** Choose from various LLMs (e.g., LLaMA3, phi3) to best suit user requirements.
- **Temperature Control:** Adjustable temperature settings allow for control over the creativity and predictability of the chatbot's responses.
- **Personalization:** Customize system instructions to adapt the chatbot's responses to different user roles and contexts, such as "lawyer" or "blockchain expert."
- **Context Recognition:** The chatbot recognizes and maintains context, reducing hallucinations and improving response accuracy.
- **Security and Privacy:** The chatbot operates locally on the user's system to ensure data privacy and security.

## **Documentation**

The project is documented in detail in the [Chatbot.docx](./Chatbot.docx) file. This document includes the project scope, design, implementation details, testing results, and user manual. It serves as a comprehensive guide for understanding the project's architecture, features, and functionalities.

## Technologies Used
- **Ollama LLaMA3:** A leading large language model for generating natural language responses.
- **LangChain:** A framework for building applications powered by LLMs.
- **Streamlit:** An open-source app framework used to create a user-friendly interface similar to ChatGPT.
- **Python:** The programming language used to develop the entire application.
